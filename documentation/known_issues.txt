# Marvel Heroes App - Known Issues

## 1. Favorites Issues
- whole system for favorite heroes is implemented, however I was unable of finding the reason why 
  it is not displaying the favorited heroes on the favorite section.
  It does store them even between sessions, but was unable to make it show.
  


## 1. API Limitations
- API Rate Limiting: The Marvel API has rate limits that may affect frequent usage
  - Current mitigation: Caching to reduce API calls
  - Error handling for rate limit responses
- Superhero API occasionally returns incomplete data for some heroes

## 3. UI/UX Issues
- Filter Persistence: Filters are not saved between app sessions
  - on the other hand it may be more comfortable for the user
- English-only interface
  - Future enhancement: Add support for multiple languages

## 5. Error Handling
- Generic error messages in some cases
  - Future fix: More specific error messages based on error type
- Network errors could have better recovery mechanisms
  - Future enhancement: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

## 6. Device Compatibility
- Layout  on only one screen
  - Future fix: Improve responsive design for various screen sizes
